# Quantum_Knapsack
The solution to the cloud resource balancing problem using a quantum algorithm in the QUBO formulation.

The cloud simulation is launched through Cloud/Simulation/Simulation.py. <br>
The distribution algorithm is located in Cloud/Distribution. <br>
The tests for the distribution algorithm and comparison with ortools are located in Multi_Knapsack/Multi_Constraint.
